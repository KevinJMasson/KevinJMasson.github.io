                    During this group project we were tasked to take an already implemented program that runs a game of Go Fish and adapt it to a REST API.
                    This was done in C++ using Corvussoft's Restbed and Niels Lohmann's JSON libraries. In this picture it shows an example of an
                    endpoint I have implemented. This endpoint uses a GET request to check the players hand for a card, and if it exists it will remove
                    the specified card. Here I added checks to reduce errors and ensure that the bulk of the code isnt run if there isn't a reason to. For example,
                    the playercheck(p) is a simple function that checks if the int p is within the scope of possible players in the game. As well, this endpoint shows
                    and example of my comfort in dealing with complex variables such as iterators, lists, and pointers.

                    Where is an example of me implementing a client-side request. Here is the part of the game logic to ask a player for a card. I use a
                    request to ask a player for a card which will return a JSON of a list of cards in the hand. If the list is greater than zero, it will then
                    loop through the list and request for the cards to be removed from the player's hand and make a request to add to the asking player's hand.
                    If the card did not exist, it will request for the player to draw from the deck.

                    Here is an example of a test I wrote to test the functionality of getting a player's hand. This was done using Google's GTEST library
                    and is run automatically from the makefile on compiling the project, along with a memory leak, static analysis, and style checker. This
                    uses both ASSERT tests and EXPECT tests to check for functionality. If the response code from the server is not 200, then there was an
                    error and the rest of the tests are irrelevant, and so I used an ASSERT test. If the JSON returned is valid, then I use EXPECT to
                    check that the outcome is as expected.
